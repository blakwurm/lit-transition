About

lit-transition is a directive for lit-html inspired by the concepts of the beautiful [transition system of vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html).

It mainly orchestrates lifecycle transitions when a dom node is updated and adds css classes or executes web animations in step with these transitions.

Currently we only support transitions


moved nodes are kept alive until

<script type="text/javascript">

alert('hi')
</script>
